Handling was not implemented for 500 errors on order placement. When these happened, it took down the system for everyone else instead of just not working for the individual.
```

## Resolution

```md
**EXAMPLE**:
By adding error handling to the database handler for creating an order, an attack like this will be prevented in the future.
```

## Prevention

**EXAMPLE**:

Changes to the codebase have been committed and pushed to production to prevent this from happening again.
```

## Action items

```md
**EXAMPLE**:

1. Error handling improved in targeted areas
2. Code reviewed, tested, and pushed to production
```
